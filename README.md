Welcome to my profile! :wave:

My name is Cristina. I created my account here on GitHub some time ago. At the time, I thought it wasn't for me.
Today, I am transitioning careers, I have found a good teacher, and I am sure that now I will be able to grow in an area that so many fear :cold_sweat:.

I studied C-sharp in the past, now I am studying Full Stack, and it's a whole new world: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, artificial intelligence, and much more.

I know that for many, the beginning is complicated, but I really hope that in the future I will be able to reap what I am sowing today.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a little about my career. I hope that in a year's time I will have new information about my career transition :relaxed:.
